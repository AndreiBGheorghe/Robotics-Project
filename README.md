# Bluetooth Remote Controlled Forklift

## Introduction

The project represents a four-wheeled RC forklift that is being controlled via Bluetooth, which has moving forks. The carriage's movement is being detected by sensors and signaled through a specific sound and blinking light.

The idea started from my passion for forklifts, that i enjoyed watching growing up, and RC cars, which were a total mystery to me. Also, tinkering is something that i have been doing for my whole life. With that being said, this project harmoniously combines many of my passions and interests.

## General Description

The RC forklift has a sliding carriage with attached forks, the movement of which is detected by sensors. They, not only signal to the buzzer and the LED that the carriage is still moving so those can play the set sound and blinking light, but have the role of detecting the ends of the sliding carriage. Two motors connected to the front wheels ensure the movement, as well as the steering of the forklift.
