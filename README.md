# Bluetooth Remote Controlled Forklift

## Introduction

The project represents a four-wheeled RC forklift that is being controlled via Bluetooth, which has moving forks. The carriage's movement is being detected by sensors and signaled through a specific sound and blinking light.

The idea started from my passion for forklifts, that i enjoyed watching growing up, and RC cars, which were a total mystery to me. Also, tinkering is something that i have been doing for my whole life. With that being said, this project harmoniously combines many of my passions and interests.
