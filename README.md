# Bluetooth Remote Controlled Forklift

## Introduction

The project represents a four-wheeled RC forklift that is being controlled via Bluetooth, which has moving forks. The carriage's movement is being signaled through a specific blinking light.

The idea started from my passion for forklifts, that i enjoyed watching growing up, and RC cars, which were a total mystery to me. Also, tinkering is something that i have been doing for my whole life. With that being said, this project harmoniously combines many of my passions and interests.

## General Description

The RC forklift has a sliding carriage with attached forks. Two LEDs are playing the set blinking light animation while the carriage is moving. The sliding is done via a servo motor which has a similar mechanism to that of a pulley. Two motors connected to the front wheels ensure the movement, as well as the steering of the forklift. This whole project revolves around the ESP32 as the main microcontroller.
